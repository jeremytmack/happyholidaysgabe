Holiday Release: Final Step

A string awaits where versions live,
Among the code you help protect and give.
To hear what silence hides inside,
This gate will help you turn the tide:
https://encrypt-online.com/decrypt

No brute force needed—keep it clean.
The key’s already been foreseen:
happyholidaysgabe
A festive phrase that opens the gate with ease.

(All lowercase. No spaces. No tricks.)

When letters fall and meaning shows,
You’re close—but that’s not quite the close.
If what you see feels more like text than sight,
Recall how some images travel light.

Not all pictures start as what they seem;
Some arrive as strings, tidy and clean.
Reframe the form. Decode the view.
You’ll know exactly what to do.
