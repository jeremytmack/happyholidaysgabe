Holiday Release: Final Step

A string awaits where versions live, <br>
Among the code you help protect and give. <br>
To hear what silence hides inside, <br>
This gate will help you turn the tide: <br>
https://encrypt-online.com/decrypt <br>
 <br>
No brute force needed—keep it clean. <br>
The key’s already been foreseen: <br>
"**happyholidaysgabe**" <br>
A festive phrase that opens the gate with ease. <br>
(All lowercase. No spaces. No tricks.) <br>
 <br>
When letters fall and meaning shows, <br>
You’re close—but that’s not quite the close. <br>
If what you see feels more like text than sight, <br>
Recall how some images travel light. <br>
 <br>
Not all pictures start as what they seem;
Some arrive as strings, tidy and clean.
Reframe the form. Decode the view.
You’ll know exactly what to do.
